Description
-----------

This set consists of Slater-Koster files derived from pbc-0-3 or mio-1-1 for testing 
purposes of specific features of the transport code.
 
H-H-noS.skf  is created to reproduce first neighbor orthogonal tight-binding results.
Si-H.skf     is created to have two non-equal 's' atoms.
Sin-Sin.skf  is created with a trick to 'n-dope' a Silicon nanowire. 
H-H.skf      is only for saturation purposes.

WARNING: These files have no physical sense and should not be used for calculations.

Required references

Not applicable since cannot be used in practical calculations
