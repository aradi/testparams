**********************************
Parametrisations for testing DFTB+
**********************************

This repository contains parametrisations (a.k.a. Slater-Koster files) for
testing the functionality of the DFTB+ software package. You should download
them before testing DFTB+ using the ``get_opt_externals`` script within the
DFTB+ source tree.

**NOTE:** Those parameters should only be used for testing DFTB+. Some of
them have been modified and may yield physically incorrect results. **Never use
these parameters for any production runs**.

If you wish to obtain parameters for your research, please consult `dftb.org
<http://www.dftb.org/>`_ for available parameters.
